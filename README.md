Developed a socialmedia application using Java and the Spring Framework. Implemented features such as user registration, post creation, liking posts, and comment handling. Leveraged Spring Boot for application configuration, Spring Data JPA for database interactions, and Maven for project management.RESTful APIs to manage backend processes and handle data efficiently.

Technical stack:
language : Java

Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA,Spring Security, Maven, RESTful APIs, JUnit , MySQL.

Spring Boot was used to create and manage the backend application with minimal configuration. It provided a rapid development environment and integrated various components seamlessly.

Spring Data JPA simplified data access and management. It enabled the use of repository interfaces to perform CRUD operations and custom queries, reducing boilerplate code and increasing productivity.

Spring Security was implemented to handle authentication and authorization. It protected the application by managing user roles and permissions, ensuring secure access to resources.

Maven was utilized for project management and build automation. It handled dependency management, build lifecycle, and project configuration through the pom.xml file.

RESTful APIs were developed to facilitate communication between the backend and other services or clients. This design allowed the application to perform CRUD operations via HTTP methods.

JUnit was used for unit testing to ensure code quality and functionality. It helped in writing and running tests for various components, verifying that the application logic was correct.

MySQL was the chosen database management system for storing and managing application data. It supported complex queries and provided reliable data storage and retrieval.
